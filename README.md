# Age-Calculator-Python-
Age calculation plays a crucial role in various fields, including healthcare, legal matters, and demographic analysis. Python, with its simplicity and powerful libraries, provides an ideal platform to develop an age calculator.


Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1)The necessary libraries are imported:
    -tkinter: This library is used for creating the graphical user interface.
    -date from datetime: This library is used for working with dates.
2)The App class is defined, representing the GUI application. It has the following features:
    -The constructor (__init__) initializes the main window of the application with specific dimensions, background color, and title.
    -The run method sets up the GUI elements, such as labels and entry boxes for the user to input their name and birthdate information.
3)The check_year, check_month, and check_day functions are defined to validate the user's input for the birth year, month, and day, respectively. They check if the input is a valid integer within the expected range. If there is an error or the input is invalid, an appropriate error message is displayed using the Label widget.
4)The ageCalc function is defined to calculate the age based on the user's input. It uses the date.today() function to get the current date and compares it with the user's birthdate. The calculated age is then displayed using the Label widget.
5)The run method continues with the setup of the GUI by creating a button that calls the ageCalc function when clicked.
6)Finally, an instance of the App class is created, and the run method is called to start the GUI application.

To summarize, this script creates a simple GUI application that allows the user to input their name and birthdate. When the user clicks the "Calculate age" button, the application calculates the age based on the current date and the provided birthdate, and displays the result on the screen.
